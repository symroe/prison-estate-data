# Register updates
## Beta12. Register moves into beta
May 2017

The prison estate register moved into beta on the 24th May 2017 and is now available to use.

## Alpha11. Review feedback from alpha
April 2017

We received a lot of valuable feedback on the alpha prison register. The majority of the feedback can be grouped under the following topics:

    Renaming the register: Some users felt the register’s name was too generic or misleading as some of the prisons listed in the register are grouped under one record, rather than two, to indicate that they are managed by the same governor. This applies to HMP USK and HMP/YOI Prescoed, which are jointly managed. As a result of this feedback GDS worked with the custodian to change the name of the register to: prison estate register.

    Adding NOMIS codes to the register: Some MOJ services require NOMIS codes (these are codes used in the National Offender Management Information System) in order to use the register. However, as the custodian is not responsible for maintaining a list of NOMIS codes we have decided not to include these in this register.

Narrowing the scope of the register:

Following the above feedback, and the resulting change to the register’s name, we decided to narrow the scope of this register to just the core information about the prison estate in England and Wales. This will prevent any confusion where separate prison locations (e.g. premises) appear under one combined record as they are jointly managed.

As a result we made the decision to remove the following fields:

    address

    operator

We are looking into creating a broader prison register - including address information - in future.
Alpha10. Alpha register is open to feedback
March 2017

The prison register has moved into alpha and is open for feedback.

The prison category or classification will not be included in the alpha register but, depending on the feedback received during alpha, this information may be added in a later iteration of the register.

A blog post highlighting the key decisions made during the register’s discovery phase, and requesting feedback on the alpha register, was published on the Ministry of Justice data blog.
Discovery9. Meet technical standards
March 2017

The prison register meets the technical standards as it’s hosted by GDS on the open register platform.
Discovery8. Meet operational standards
March 2017

The prison register meets the operational standards as it’s hosted by GDS on the open register platform.
Discovery7. Review how register is updated
February 2017

The custodian, Richard Carling, already has a process for maintaining the existing list of prisons used internally in Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service and will update and improve this process to maintain and update the register.
Discovery6. Review how feedback is collected
February 2017

There will be a link to provide feedback at the top of each page of the alpha prison register. All feedback will be sent to the registers team at GDS. Both the registers team and the custodian will respond to feedback, depending on whether it relates to the registers product or the data.
Discovery5. Find duplicate lists
March 2017

GDS identified five duplicate prison lists, published by different teams within the Ministry of Justice, and reviewed and compared the data in them against the list provided by Richard Carling (the custodian).
Discovery4. Agree dataset
February 2017

It was agreed, with the custodian, that the following fields would feature in the register:

    Prison
    Name
    Operator
    Address
    Start-date
    End-date

January 2017

Richard Carling, the register’s custodian, provided GDS with the prison data he maintains. GDS compared this data to other prison datasets used across government and reviewed the results with Richard so he could decide what data should be included in the alpha version of the register.
Backlog3. Agree a custodian
December 2016

Richard Carling was proposed and agreed as the custodian of the prison register because he owns and maintains the list of prisons published by the Prison and Probation Service, which is already used by a number of existing services.
Backlog2. Register is accepted
November 2016

The prison register was approved by Paul Downey at GDS.

The Ministry of Justice was accepted by GDS as the register’s authority because of its overall responsibility for prisons in England and Wales.
Backlog1. Request a register
November 2016

The prison register was proposed by a number of product teams that use prison data in their services (services that are managed by the Ministry of Justice).

* Managed by: Ministry of Justice
* Custodian: Richard Carling
* Register: https://prison-estate.register.gov.uk
